## Changes Made

* Added semantic HTML elements such as section, article, aside.
* Added relevant titles
* Added alt attribues to images.
* Commented on the CSS file for increased clarity.
* Fixed nav links so they all work.
* Combined multiple CSS styles to one which affects more than one item.
* Re-organized HTML and CSS so they would match more and were in an order that made sense.
